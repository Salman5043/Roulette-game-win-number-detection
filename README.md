🎲 Roulette Winning Number Detection

This project detects the winning number in an online roulette game using YOLO (object detection) and EasyOCR (text recognition).

The system is designed to:

✅ Detect the winning number only from the right 50% of your Windows screen

✅ Use YOLO for object detection (roulette board, ball, etc.)

✅ Use EasyOCR for text extraction (winning number)

✅ Start detection only when you press "Start Detection"

✅ Run without requiring a game window title
